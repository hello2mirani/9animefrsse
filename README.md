# 9anime-clone

This is a finished frontend project that I completed in 2nd year of my grad school

This project along with the google search page clone is when I was learning and getting to know web development and also was using it for polishing my raw web develpment skills with simple HTML, CSS and JS.

As the google search page clone was made using a step by step tutorial but this 9anime clone is made by me with no guidance.

This clone is not responsive at all cause I was not up to the level for learning responsiveness when I made this clone.
But maybe in future I will try to make it responsive. Maybe.
It uses the vanilla css for styling and has 0 javascript code behind for the working
